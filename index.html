    <p class="overview">
        Peace! I am a Certified Yoga Instructor that loves to code. I am in this program to achieve my career goal as a software engineer. I know that this bootcamp will provide me with comprehensive training in both front-end and back-end development to do just that. I am excited and ready to continue my journey with Grand Circus in April 2024!
    </p>
    
    <h2  id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
    <p>I have always had a passion for a career in tech since grade school. However, I fell in love with coding my freshman year in college back in 2012. Coding was just very intriguing to me. I have coded webpages for different school projects, and even for my own yoga business. I find pure joy with coding, being able to create, and I look forward to doing more of it.</p>
    <p>I have had my eyes on Grand Circus for some years now. It wasn't until I knew for sure I was ready to take the next steps and switch career paths, that I applied for the Apple Foundation Program GC offered in 2023. Once I committed to the AFP, I knew this was the right time to keep going for the end results. Grand Circus staff, from admissions to the instructors, have been so welcoming and helpful. I love feeling like I am apart of a team that wants everyone involved to succeed. </p>
